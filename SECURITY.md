# Security
This project serves just as an example on the first steps it takes to create an actual compiler. **We do not expect anyone to base an actual compiler on this project**. With that being said, we expect this compiler to be **buggy & incomplete**.

Nevertheless, we take Security seriously, even though -*at the time of writing*- we are a team of CS undergraduates, and we will do our best to fix any open issue.

If you have disclosed a security vulnerability, please feel free to [open an issue][issues] or [create a pull request][pull-request].

Since the project is **intended primarily for educational use**, there should be no concern for any security issue making vulnerable an end user to an attack.
